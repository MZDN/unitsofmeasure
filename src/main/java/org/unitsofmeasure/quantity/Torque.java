 * This interface represents the moment of a force. The system unit for this
 * quantity is "N.m" (Newton-Metre).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note: The Newton-metre ("N.m") is also a way of expressing a Joule (unit of
 * energy). However, torque is not energy. So, to avoid confusion, we will use
 * the units "N.m" for torque and not "J". This distinction occurs due to the
 * scalar nature of energy and the vector nature of torque.
